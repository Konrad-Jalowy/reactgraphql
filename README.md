# reactgraphql

Learning project done with some course. I wanna learn how to connect graphql backend api to frontend React.

## Project (done)
Done.
- Simple server with single query, all query and mutations (both using input type and not).
- Connected to react via apollo client
- Getting all entires, single entry (by id) and mutation from React
- Great project that taught me how to connect React and graphql server together
